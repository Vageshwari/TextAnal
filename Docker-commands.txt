Containize application by running docker

How to create requirements.txt?
flask
flasgger
mod_wsgi

How to fire Docker in windows :
1. docker build -t 'name of image' .

How to see docker process is running
1. docker ps
2. docker images

How to run image?
5000 port of host machine binds with 5000 port of docker machine
1. docker run -p 5000:5000 'name of image'

For api to run on host , specific ip address has to be metioned in app.run() function. Else application cannot be accessed via url

Below command is for invoking development server
CMD python flask_api.py

But to do Docker deployment with Flask we need industry grade we server e.g apache , Nginx

WSGI : web server gateway interface :is required betn Flask and Apache server

Apache can handle user request even 1000 per second
it routes the request to Flask appServer thro' WSGI

So we will put Flask server +WSGI + Apache server in docker
